# adventofcode2018

Hey there! This is my take for [adventofcode2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/). Please know that I have no prior experience with adventofcode and I am doing this challenge in golang where I have no practical experience whatsoever. But why?

I met with some of my friends here on Local Hack Day (MLH hosted by GitHub) and we agreed to start solving adventofcode every midnight in golang, where we have no experience. If I wanted to try to be on the top of leaderboards, I would do this thing in `python`, `sed`, and `awk`. You can do everything in `awk`. Absolute madlad who is #1 globally does everything in `Ruby`.

I just want to get better in `go`. First days are going to be rough. Code is going to be messy, design irrational, performance slow and answers incorrect (I hope at least this one will be wrong). I hope I will get better at it, bear with me.

When I finish solving days, I understand how I could have used `structs` instead of `maps`. Or use simple string manipulation instead of `regexp`.

I have final exams this December, so I don't know how it is gonna be. Probably will do it the day when released (not midnight). I also have lots of flights before Christmas.

We will get through this.
